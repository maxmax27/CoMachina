# Comachina (Preview)

Somehow, my work is slowly becoming more like the Windows Copilot. 

Introducing Comachina App: 
A hybrid WebView2 app designed to simplify navigation through Windows 11/10. 
It's a static client currently without AI integration, but it not only talks like the Windows Copilot but also takes action. You can access and adjust crucial areas of Windows and even make some of the most important settings with it. It's still an early preview version, but it's up and running. I'm not quite sure which direction to take it in yet, eagerly awaiting what Microsoft has in store for AI and app integration. Feel free to check it out if you're interested.  

The app is supposed to do what the Windows Copilot was initially meant to do (hopefully it'll be able to do that someday) â€“ navigate through options, open settings, and make system handling easier. Over time, the app will encompass many functions and possibly absorb some features or entire apps from me. Microsoft is implementing its AI plans more aggressively. Even our beloved Notepad might be affected. Curious to see where Microsoft heads, and I'll be throwing down with Copilotic accordingly. Check out the first sneak peek and drop some suggestions.

For the future, Copilotic could acquire functionalities in this direction.
- Enable users to control various aspects of their Windows 11 system 
- Provide quick access to important settings
- Implement features to assist users 
- Allow users to customize system settings 
- Educate users about best practices for maintaining privacy and security.
- Analyze user feedback to enhance the app's capabilities over time.
