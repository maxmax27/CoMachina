# Copilotic (Preview)

Maybe a few of you caught wind of my public MSBob project (It was too short-lived, lasting only 10 days) . Today, I am primarily parting ways with the name and the homage to Microsoft Bob (The only thing that is still remaining is the name of the assistant "Bob"). 

The idea of a universal Windows assistant persists and will now be continued with **Copilotic**. The app is supposed to do what the Windows Copilot was initially meant to do (hopefully it'll be able to do that someday) â€“ navigate through options, open settings, and make system handling easier. Currently, all of this without AI support. Over time, the app will encompass many functions and possibly absorb some features or entire apps from me. Microsoft is implementing its AI plans more aggressively. Even our beloved Notepad might be affected. Curious to see where Microsoft heads, and I'll be throwing down with Copilotic accordingly. Check out the first sneak peek and drop some suggestions.

For the future, Copilotic could acquire functionalities in this direction.
- Enable users to control various aspects of their Windows 11 system 
- Provide quick access to important settings
- Implement features to assist users 
- Allow users to customize system settings 
- Educate users about best practices for maintaining privacy and security.
- Analyze user feedback to enhance the app's capabilities over time.
