# Copilotic (Preview)

Perhaps some of you have already noticed more about my public MSBob project (I saw it today myself on the German blog Deskmodder). Today, I am primarily parting ways with the name and the homage to Microsoft Bob (The only thing that is still remaining is the name of the assistant "Bob"). The idea of a universal Windows assistant persists and will now be continued with **Copilotic**. Over time, the app will encompass many functions and possibly absorb some features or entire apps from me. Microsoft is implementing its AI plans more aggressively. Even our beloved Notepad might be affected. I am curious about the direction Microsoft takes, and accordingly, I will react with Copilotic. You can already take a look at the first preview and share your suggestions.

For the future, Copilotic could acquire functionalities in this direction.
- Enable users to control various aspects of their Windows 11 system 
- Provide quick access to important settings
- Implement features to assist users 
- Allow users to customize system settings 
- Educate users about best practices for maintaining privacy and security.
- Analyze user feedback to enhance the app's capabilities over time.
